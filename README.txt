4. 12V PSU mounting holes       = Base line = floor of board
                                  #1 4mm circle                     92mm from base
                                  #2 4mm circle                     7mm from base, 122mm left of hole #1
                              
5. Drawer face                  = 50mm-70mm x ???                   in the middle of the front panel
6. Drawer handle hole           = 4mm circle                        in center/bottom of drawer
7. Drawer roller holes          = Base line = 20cm from bottom
                                  #1 4mm hole                       13mm from front, 13mm above base line
                                  #2 4mm hole                       52mm from front line, on base line
                                  #3 4mm hole                       131mm from front line, on base line
                              
8. Corner brace holes           = Two types
                                  #1 4mm hole                       16mm from base line
                                  #2  4mm hole                      26mm from base line
